# makeReadable


When the robot reads on iphone, if there isn't this convention: punctuation, space, capitalized letter, the robot does not treat it as the end of the sentence, and thus there is no pause.  * Since one of my former writing style conventions was to never capitalize, these are uncomfortably read. Since we can manipulate strings easily, how could we create a new file with these conventions?
