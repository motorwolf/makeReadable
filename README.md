# makeReadable


Did you eschew properly punctuating and capitalizing new sentences in your writing as a matter of style? You rebel! Well you may have noticed that the robot who reads on iphone will treat these uncapitalized sentences as one long sentence.

When the robot reads on iphone, if there isn't this convention: punctuation, space, capitalized letter, the robot does not treat it as the end of the sentence, and thus there is no pause.  * Since one of my former writing style conventions was to never capitalize, these are uncomfortably read. Since we can manipulate strings easily, how could we create a new file with these conventions?
